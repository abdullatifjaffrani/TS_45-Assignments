// Assignment no 19

//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, 
// or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// First we store Languages in Array
let language: string[] = ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'Ruby', 'Java', 'C++', 'C#'];

// Now we are creating for each so we can create a list of these languages
language.forEach(languages => {
    console.log(languages);
    
});
